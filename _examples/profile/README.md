Running the profile example

## Setup

The YotiClient is the SDK entry point. To initialise it you need include the following snippet inside your endpoint initialisation section:

```Go
clientSdkID := "your-client-sdk-id"
key, err := ioutil.ReadFile("path/to/your-application-pem-file.pem")
if err != nil {
    // handle key load error
}

client, err := yoti.NewClient(
    clientSdkID,
    key)
```

Where:

* `"your-client-sdk-id"` is the SDK Client Identifier generated by Yoti Hub in the Key tab when you create your application.

* `path/to/your-application-pem-file.pem` is the path to the application pem file. It can be downloaded from the Keys tab in the [Yoti Hub](https://hub.yoti.com/).

Please do not open the pem file as this might corrupt the key, and you will need regenerate your key.

Keeping your settings and access keys outside your repository is highly recommended. You can use a package like [godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv) to manage environment variables more easily.


## Running the Profile Example

1. Change directory to the profile example folder: `cd _examples/profile`
2. On the [Yoti Hub](https://hub.yoti.com/):
   1. Set the application domain of your app to `localhost:8080`
   2. Set the scenario callback URL to `/profile`
3. Rename the [.env.example](_examples/profile/.env.example) file to `.env` and fill in the required configuration values (mentioned in the [Configuration](#configuration) section)
4. Build with `go build`
5. Start the compiled program by running `./profile`

Visiting `https://localhost:8080/` should show a webpage with a Yoti button rendered on it
